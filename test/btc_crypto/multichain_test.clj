  "VERIFICATION GATE for the Bitcoin-fork networks (Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin
  Cash) and for CashAddr.

  None of the constants under test were transcribed from memory. Each was measured:
  the P2PKH version byte by Base58Check-decoding a real address of that chain, and
  each address FORMAT by a live THORChain node accepting a derived address as a
  destination for that chain (a node that rejects malformed addresses, and that
  demonstrably discriminates — see the docstrings in `btc-crypto.core/networks`).

  The CashAddr vector below is the strongest kind available for a checksum: a real
  BCH address that a live node accepted, whose checksum verifies under this
  implementation, and which is reproduced character-for-character by decoding it and
  re-encoding the hash. A single wrong generator constant fails that."
