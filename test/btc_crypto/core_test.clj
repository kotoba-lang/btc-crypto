  "VERIFICATION GATE for btc-crypto.core: SHA256d against the real Bitcoin
  genesis block header (fetched live from blockstream.info's esplora API,
  cross-checked against an independent Python hashlib.sha256 computation —
  see the ADR/session notes for how this was obtained), and WIF/P2PKH/P2WPKH
  address derivation for the famous privkey=1 test vector (compressed pubkey
  = the secp256k1 generator point G; P2PKH address
  1BgGZ9tcN4rm9KBzDn7KprQz87SZ26SAMH and WIF
  KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH7LrciVrZi3qYjgd9M7rFU73sVHnoWn are widely-cited
  reference values for this key). The P2WPKH address for privkey=1 also
  happens to be the BIP-173 example address (bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4) —
  an independent cross-check between two unrelated spec vectors."
