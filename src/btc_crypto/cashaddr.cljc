(ns btc-crypto.cashaddr
  "CashAddr — Bitcoin Cash's address format. Needed because BCH abandoned
  Base58Check for its own encoding, so a BCH address cannot be produced by the
  Base58 or Bech32 code already in this library.

  It LOOKS like Bech32 and shares its charset, which is the trap: the checksum is
  a different code entirely — a 40-bit BCH code with its own five generator
  constants, against Bech32's 30-bit one. Reusing Bech32's polymod would produce
  strings that look exactly like valid addresses and are not.

  So the constants here are not transcribed on faith. They are validated in
  `test/btc_crypto/test_cashaddr.cljc` against a real BCH address that BOTH
  verifies under this checksum AND was accepted by a live THORChain node as a
  valid BCH destination (a node that rejects malformed addresses with \"unable to
  parse address\", making it a usable independent oracle). Decoding that address
  and re-encoding its hash reproduces it character for character; a wrong
  generator constant fails that immediately.

  :clj-only, matching the rest of this library — the 40-bit polymod needs real
  64-bit integer arithmetic, and ClojureScript's bitwise operators are 32-bit
  (the same hazard documented in eth-crypto.core, where a naive port would have
  silently computed wrong values rather than failing to compile)."
